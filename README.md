Write a C++ program that uses a single stack that will read postfix expressions and prints their values. Each input expression will be on its own line as shown in the postfix.txt file. The output of each expression should be displayed on the console screen in an attractive manner. The program should terminate when the end of the file is reached.



Assume only binary operators and that the expression contain no variables. Note that you will need to use parentheses to indicate the order of application of the operators in the expression. For example:

InputOutput787878 6 +8478 6 + 9 2 – /12 ( 78 + 6 ) / ( 9 – 2 )

Use the postfix.txt file to test your program. Be sure to set your program to read from this file.

The contents of postfix.txt:

78

78 6


78 6 + 9 2 – /
